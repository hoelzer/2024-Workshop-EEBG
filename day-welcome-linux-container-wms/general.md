## General information & Setup

* This GitHub repository will guide you through the whole workshop
    * That means, that we will also jump a bit around between this repository, slide decks, the terminal, demo examples, and hands-on sessions
* You will find example commands in this workshop repository
    * **keep in mind** that these are examples! You should always familiarize yourself with a bioinformatics tool (read the publication, the GitHub README, ...)
    * we will mostly use default parameter settings if not otherwise stated, which might be not optimal for your own data!
    * remember that `--help` and google (and ChatGPT...) are your friends! 
* Please raise your hand to ask a question at any time
* There will be usually "lecture" parts followed by practical hands-on 
* We will work on Linux systems (or Mac or the Windows Subsystem for Linux)
    * this can be your own laptops or provided ones
    * if you are not used to a Linux system yet, we will give a crash-course but highly recommend you continue working and learning on Linux systems if you want to continue doing bioinformatics

So, let's get started!
