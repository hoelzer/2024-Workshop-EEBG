# Workshop - Metagenome assembly, binning, qc, and annotation

In this part, we will reconstruct microbial genomes from our long-read metagenomic sequencing data. We will show, how different species can be recovered from metagenomes (_binning_) and how to assess their completeness and potential contaminations. Finally, we will annotate the genomes and search for genes.
